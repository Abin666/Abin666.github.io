                                I am pursuing a bachelor degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Karunya Institute of Technology and Sciences, Coimbatore, India.
                            </p>
                            <p class="bla">
                                I am an Entrepreneur, a Full- Stack Web-developer, a Graphic designer, an UI and UX Developer  by passion, a basketball lover and an artist. I believe that art is not what you simply see but it's what you feel deep within when you see something. And that is what I try to bring up in all the designs for different platform that I make. Playing with colours is not an easy task, colours are a language that you speak. They act as a means of communication between an artist and the viewer. Bringing up the sense of perfection is what I intend to display in my designs. I have learns this by knowledge as well as experience. 
                            </p>
                            <p class="bla">
                                Making plenty of designs helped me to analyse my work and make it better. My college was where my journey started. I got a glimpse of Graphic designing, and Web development which made to design UI and UX for Software  when I started to work with my seniors at various events. It sounds interesting but trust me, it’s not. I took up some responsibilities at first cause I knew not where to start. It was a rough start though. Many of my designs were rejected but then I make it through. My work at computer technology center at karunya university for a period of about 6 months did not go in vain. I found people to guide me and help me get a better grip at the basics skills I wanted. Then slowly I came out of the beginner phase and I realized that I came with more responsibilities. I designed huge Resume Design, Portfolio Design, Backdrops, and Posters for a lot many events and then I learnt about Entrepreneurship. 
                            </p>
                            <p class="bla">
                                This new word in my dictionary, added another way to my college life. It was a kind of a “road less travelled”. I made a group of three or four friends and went around if somebody wanted me to design resume for them. I reached out to teachers, who helped me publicise more. I started with one or two and it took me hours to complete one resume. This was one phase where I realized that I had to work on my speed too. And when the time for placements for my seniors was nearing, I realised that a lot many people asked me to help them out with it. This was a very good chance for me to showcase my talent. 
                            </p>
                            <p class="bla">
                                And today I am here, as an UI and UX Developer, who is still learning and who can still face any trial, no matter what it costs. I believe that this wasn’t easy as it sounds, but it make my life way too interesting that it ever was.
                            </p>
                            <p class="bla">
                                I have a lot of Experience that has made me a ready to hire developer with the latest skills and applications of cutting edge technology on different interfaces.
